`Hookstores` is an elementary [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview) implementation using React hooks.

## üìö motivation

- React is no more a `View` lib, it's now (v17) a complete framework: so either we pick a lighter lib for the `View`, or choosing React ‚ùå **we shouldn't need to use an additional external framework** such as Redux, MobX, RxJs, Recoil, Jotail...

- A first approach could be to use local states and sporadic use of React context, like [explained here by Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react), but ‚ùå it's not a proper Flux implementation, I'd rather have **my entire app state fully separated from the `View`**, and "connect" [containers](https://medium.com/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005), mapping sub-states to the views, the way Redux allows to.

- Using React context for a global app state, like [suggested here by Rico Sta. Cruz](https://ricostacruz.com/til/state-management-with-react-hooks), [or here by Ebenezer Don](https://blog.logrocket.com/use-hooks-and-context-not-react-and-redux/), would be ok for a _small application_, but would quickly lead to ‚ùå **tons of useless re-renderings**.
  That would eventually lead to lots of specific `useMemo` on every component requiring performance optimisation.
  So rather than to put the effort on developping on a proper state/component architecture, your effort will be spent on ‚ùå **writing those `useMemo` everywhere**.

## üßô experimentation

The idea with `hookstores` is to implement a simple [Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview)

- ‚úÖ **splitting** the global app state into **stores**,
- ‚úÖ applying **local rendering**, by mapping these stores to [containers](https://medium.com/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005), using React hooks `useState` and `useEffect`.
- ‚úÖ using React context only to provide `Hookstores` with `{dispatch, ...stores}` everywhere,

  - `dispatch` allows to emitting actions to every stores, and they now if they have to compute this action to reduce a new state.

  - your `stores` are accessible, with the `key` you give in `descriptions`, to allow kind of "mapStateToProps" on the connected containers, only when there _is_ an update: Now that's local re-rendering.

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è disclaimer

So yes, somehow it ends up as another lib to manage your React state üôÉ.

But since it's only few files you should understand what's behind the hood, then use and tweak them to your convenience _within your own React app_ rather than use it out of the box.

You'll see hookstores is rather few lines to patch React.

Furthermore,

- ‚ö†Ô∏è it's not written in typescript üôÄ
- ‚ö†Ô∏è there are no tests üí•

That being said,

- ‚úÖ I'm confidently using this implementation between many apps,
- ‚úÖ so I prefer to have this package,
- ‚úÖ so why not sharing this experiment.

## üì¶ installation

```sh
> npm i --save hookstores
```

---

## üõ† setup

Under the hood, the `Hookstores` uses [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

As such, you can wrap your root component, such as `App`, with the provider called `Hookstores` for convenience, to integrate it with your React app.

```jsx
<Hookstores>
  <App />
</Hookstores>
```

---

In the following, let's illustrate how to use hookstores with:

- a store of `Items` and its fetch function
- a `container` plugged to this store,
- and the `component` rendering the list of items.

---

### descriptions

Hookstores will create stores, register for actions, and emit updates using the descriptions you provide.

Each store has its own description, which must export:

- an `initialState`,
- a list of `handledActions`, from which this store needs to update its state.
- a function `computeAction`, which is basically what redux calls a "reducer", computing a new store state as a reaction to each action.

```js
const itemsStoreDescription = {
  initialState: {},
  handledActions: [],
  computeAction: () => ({})
};

export default itemsStoreDescription;
```

üîç When you describe many stores:

- you should use one store for one feature (here the `items`)
- define within `computeAction` how a store must update its state for every `handledAction`:

Here is the example for our illustrating `itemsStore`:

```js
/* ./features/items/store-description.js */
import fetchItems from './fetch-items.js';

const FETCH_ITEMS = 'FETCH_ITEMS';

const computeAction = async (currentState, action) => {
  let newState;

  switch (action.type) {
    case FETCH_ITEMS: {
      const items = await fetchItems();
      newState = {...currentState, items};
      break;
    }
    default:
      newState = {...currentState};
  }

  return newState;
};

const itemsStoreDescription = {
  initialState: {items: null},
  handledActions: [FETCH_ITEMS],
  computeAction
};

export default itemsStoreDescription;
export {FETCH_ITEMS};
```

---

Once all descriptions are ready, you give them names, and pass them as parameters to `<Hookstores>`

```js
/* ./index.js */

import itemsStore from './features/items/store-description.js';
import anyOtherStore from './features/whatever/store-description.js';

<Hookstores
  descriptions={{
    quizzesStore,
    anyOtherStore
  }}
>
  <App />
</Hookstores>;
```

---

### apply state changes to components props

Use `connectStore` to register your container to store changes.

Then map the store state to your component props, using your container state.

```js
import React, {useLayoutEffect, useState} from 'react';
import ItemsComponent from './component';
import {connectStore} from 'hookstores';

const ItemsContainer = props => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState();
  const {itemsStore} = props;

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    const onStoreUpdate = storeState => {
      setItems(storeState.items);
    };

    const disconnect = connectStore(itemsStore, onStoreUpdate);

    return disconnect;
  }, []);

  return <ItemsComponent items={items} />;
};
```

üîç Don't forget to return the `disconnect` function at the end of your hook, unless you will have stores updates triggering unmounted containers updates.

---

### dispatching actions from containers

Use [`prop drilling`](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling) from your containers to your components: pass functions dispatching the actions

```js
import {useHookstores} from 'hookstores';
import {SELECT_ITEM} from 'path/to/actions';

const ItemsContainer = props => {
  const {dispatch} = useHookstores();

  const selectItem = id => () => {
    dispatch({
      type: SELECT_ITEM,
      itemId: id
    });
  };

  return <ItemsComponent selectItem={selectItem} />;
};
```
